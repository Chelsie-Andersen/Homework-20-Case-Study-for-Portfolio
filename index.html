    <h3>Non-Profit Website Redesign</h3>
    <p>Tasha's Furry Friends is a non profit cat sanctuary that takes in senior, special needs, & long term shelter cats. Some of the cats are rehomed, while many others spend the rest of their lives at the sanctuary.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Why Redesign?</h2>
          <p class="lead">Before conducting interviews, we collectively felt the site was somewhat outdated, confusing and text heavy.
             <br>We needed to find out if users understood the non-profits mission, how TFF was providing solutions, and why they should donate to the cause.</p>
             <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">The Approach</h2>
             <p class="lead">The main focus of our rebrand was to build connection with the users in a way that would pull them into the cat's stories, making them want to get involved with the charity.
               <br>We also updated the site with clean, crisp, easy to grasp pages that were built according to user feedback.

            <br>For Tasha's Fury Friends, the non-profit is looking to adopt out forgotten cats, raise money to rebuild and expand their sanctuary, and provide low cost spay and neuter options to those in need.</p>

      The narration provides context of how the site will be able to not only maximize reoccurring donations, but also increase the number of cat adoptions.<br>      
      It was important to highlight how we could pull customers into reoccurring donations in a way that is quick to understand, and easy to remember.<br>      
      The storyboard was often revisited during the design process, providing a reflection point to the main purpose as many iterations are made.<br></p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Initial Wireframes</h2>
    <p class="lead">Based on the problems identified above, initial product solutions where drafted into lo-fi wireframes in Figma, with a focus on addressing the main pain points.
     <br> Next, the wireframes were slightly enhanced with some basic imagery and text, and shared within our design team for feedback.
     <br>During the iteration phase the pages were refined by sampling several different placements of the elements, adjusting the size of various components, and adding and removing features based on the collective opinion.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Style Guide</h2>
    <p class="lead">After we concluded the iterations, our team sat down and constructed a formal style guide to make sure we could maintain a cohesive look throughout all pages and functions during the building process.
      <br>For our style guide we wanted to pull in some color psychology and use colors that would tie to our cause. We landed on the color purple, because it combines the “compassion” element of the color blue with the “Taking Action” element of the color red -and this is what we were looking for – people to feel compassion for our cats, and then take action to help them.
      <br>We also found some nice, simple easy to read fonts, updated our logo, and again really focused on pictures to tell our story.</p>

      <br>The visual design was centered around simplifying the flow, and arranging items in a way that guides the users eye along the intended path. The new layout delivers a solution that is easy for users to navigate.
      <br>High quality images of cats were pulled in to help users empathize with the cause.</p>

<div class="mobile text-center">
  <h2>Mobile Version</h2>
  <p>It is crucial to create an adaptable mobile version of a website in today's digital landscape, as more and more people are accessing websites from mobile devices. Doing a separate build out for mobile devices optimizes the user experience, makes the site easy to navigate, and helps the content to load faster. Separate mobile development also increases SEO, as google and other search engines prioritize mobile friendly websites in their search results.
    <br>In this case we were able to use smaller images, shorten text, add a mobile friendly navigation, and utilize carousels - which allow users to swipe through options rather than having to scroll excessively.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="lead">This redesign was a fun project for a good cause. I expanded my skill set as a research and a designer. The most important things I learned are:</p>
    <ol class="Lessons">
      <li>User Research is the Best Tool:. Truly understanding who your users are, what they need, and how they behave will result in happy customers and clients.</li>
      <li>Focus on Being User Centered: The goal should always be to create a user-centered design that makes reaching goals simple and enjoyable.</li>
      <li>Keep it Simple: An easy and intuitive site with clear navigation, logical structure, and smooth user flows gets the best result.</li>
      <li>Iterate, Test & Iterate More: A website redesign can't be nailed in one take, to make it successful you must appreciate the ongoing process of testing and iteration.</li>
      <li>The Sponsor a Cat Landing Page</li>
      <li>Collaboration for the Win: A website redesign requires teamwork between all parties involved. Regular communication keeps us aligned on the project goals and vision.</li>
